# Trigger a time model error

- `daml build`
- `daml ledger upload-dar .daml/dist/the-horribly-slow-fibonacci-with-the-extremely-inefficient-algorithm-0.0.1.dar --host "$HOST" --port "$PORT"`
- `daml script --dar .daml/dist/the-horribly-slow-fibonacci-with-the-extremely-inefficient-algorithm-0.0.1.dar --script-name Test:run --ledger-host "$HOST" --ledger-port "$PORT" --input-file <(echo "$N")`
- increase "$N" until a time model error is reported, e.g. `Error: User abort: Submit failed with code 10: Invalid ledger time: Record time 2020-09-04T14:08:04.716Z outside of range [2020-09-04T14:06:55.408Z, 2020-09-04T14:07:55.408Z]`
- failures usually happen somewhere in the early 30s, a suggested progression can be `1 10 20 30 31 32 33...`
